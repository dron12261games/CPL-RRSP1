Description             : Version 2 - some polishing and fixes
                          
                          Version 3 - a separate special version for Doom 
                          Retro
                          
                          But really, this level was not created just to pass
                          and forget it. It's kind of an act of passing on my
                          experience to other mappers. On this map, I showed
                          how you can use special Boom actions and tricks to
                          customize incredible lighting in Doom.
                          Unfortunately I haven't seen much of this in other
                          maps, and I know that many mappers don't even know
                          about it. So I urge mappers from small to large:
                          Open this map in Doom Builder and take it apart
                          piece by piece, and then you'll have a powerful new
                          tool in your pocket and some clever tricks for
                          mapping your maps already.
                          
                          The archive also has my prepared palette for boom 
                          lighting as a prefab.
                          
                          On Doom Retro, the regular version of the map will 
                          not display correctly in some places, as Fake 
                          Contrast is implemented a bit differently there. 
                          It is also recommended to update Doom Retro to 
                          version 5.0.3.
