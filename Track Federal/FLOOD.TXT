Description             : Flood... 
                          An ominous atmospheric map that takes place in the
                          flooded ruins of a medieval castle. Monotonous
                          texturing with elaborated shadows. The gameplay is
                          based on a limit of health resources, weapons and a
                          large number of shotgunners, kinda similar to
                          original E4M1, but much less annoying. Blind run
                          will take about 5 minutes.
