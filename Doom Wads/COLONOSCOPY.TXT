Description             : Doomguy currently works as a proctologist and
                          performs colonoscopies on people, since all demons
                          on Mars and Earth have been destroyed, but he does
                          it in a very interesting way. In the old days he
                          stole a shrinking device in the UAC and now sneaks
                          into people's rectums himself, shrinking to a few
                          centimeters, destroying helminths and other
                          parasites by presenting them as former enemies.
